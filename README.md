# AuxiunCrypto

## We are creating a private blockchain to revolutionize the way players control their assets in video games.

### Project Scope

There is two teams working to complete this capstone project:

Our team is creating the private and public blockchain with the standards needed for our tokens. This blockchain will have the capability to create smart contracts (public and private), and interact with an IPFS to help distribute data through the IPLD protocol. We will also be responsible for publishing our blockchain to the cloud.

The other team is creating the wallet that is able to hold tokens in our desired standards, and interact with a game or account so it can be used by users. This wallet will need to interact with our private blockchain, as well as the tokenizer that will be a part of our next step.

At the end both teams will work on completing the project by creating a tokenizer with our desired standards. It must have transferring capabilities so that we can move tokens in and out of the wallet, and will have the capabaility to mass product tokens.

Token Standards: Fungible (ERC-20), Non-Fungible tokens (ERC-721) and Mult-Token (ERC-1155)

### Getting Started

You will need to clone this repo to get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/JesseHarasym/AuxiunCrypto.git
```

If you are planning on using smart contracts, you must make sure that you have the required dependencies, first ensure you're in the SmartContracts folder and then type

```
npm install
```

All dependencies in the package.json will be downloaded for you, and you should be ready to go.

Further instructions to interacting with the blockchain can be viewed under the PrivateBlockchain folder.

### Projects State

We are currently in the planning and early development stage. The readme will be updated with more detailed instructions for setup as we get closer to the end of development.

### Expected Completion Date

Our final coding sprint is planned to be completed by April 5, 2021.
